## About / Use Case

This is my first capstone for the Bloc.io webdev course.
I created a chat app to let friends and strangers share and discuss their favorite music.
The goal is to create the best possible place to share music online.
Right now the app is simple so the use case is not super compelling.
But once more features are added it will be worth it.

## Colors

My vision: the inside of a lava lamp :P

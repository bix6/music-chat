### Dick
- Loves the deployment
- "Chat apps are a rite of passage"

- J: Do you think the app is interesting/valuable?
- D: Is the idea a shared playlist kind of thing? That people can then discuss? I wouldn't use it but I could see people that like music and talking about music using it.
    - TODOD Clarify use case
- J: Do you understand how to use the app?
- D: Yup
- J: Any bugs or broken features?
- D: Issue loading youtube videos. Some results stream, others don't.
    - TODOD: I noticed this and have a ticket open. I think youtube blocks some videos from embedding so I need to see if I can get this info from an endpoint.
- D: split the searchbox into two
    - TODOD I went back and forth on this. I think two is better.
- D: Bug w/ username going Jack -> Jac -> Ja -> J in global chat
    - Not a bug I just hardcoded this :p
- J: Is basic functionality working?
- D: Yes but fix bugs
    - D make dick happy
- J: What would make the app better?
- D: User Accounts and saved chat history
    - TODOD user accounts 
    - TODOD saved chat (code api)
- D: How do you intend this to be different than just a group message? I could do the same thing on Slack.
    - TODOD differentiate music features
- J: Would you ever seriously use this app?
